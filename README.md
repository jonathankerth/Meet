# Meet App
Objective
The objective of this project is to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

Context
The Meet App combines the benefits of serverless architecture and PWAs, which includes:

Serverless: No backend maintenance, easy to scale, always available, no cost for idle time.
PWAs: Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, "add to home screen" prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.
The app is built using TDD to ensure high-quality code, and data visualization is used to make the app more visually appealing and informative.

Key Features
Filter events by city.
Show/hide event details.
Specify the number of events.
Use the app when offline.
Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.
User Stories
As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.
As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event.
As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.
As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster.
As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.
